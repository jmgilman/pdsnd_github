# Bike Share Analysis Tool

This tool consists of a single script which performs various pre-determined
calculations on raw bike share data from motivateco.com given in CSV format. For
each run of the tool, the following statistics are calculated:

1. Popular times of travel
    * Most common month
    * Most common day of week
    * Most common hour of day
2. Popular stations and trip
    * Most common start station
    * Most common end station
    * Most common trip from start to end
3. Trip duration
    * Total travel time
    * Average travel time
4. User info
     * Counts of each user type
    * Counts of each gender (NYC and Chicago)
    * Eariest, most recent, most common year of both (NYC and Chicago)

## Usage
Clone or download the source documents to your computer. **You must supply the
appropriate CSV files in order for the script to execute properly.** Place each
of these .csv files in a directory entitled `data` in the root directory of the
project. It's recommended you name the .csv files after their respective city
names, using underscores to denote spaces. 

Run the `bikeshare.py` file to begin the interactive session. Follow the prompts
in order to begin the data processing. You will have the option to filter by
month, day of the week, or both. After filtering, the above statistics will be
outputted to the terminal. After the calculations are performed, you will have
the option to view the raw data, paginated by 5 rows at a time.
